Returns the found HDR interval as a vector with length two.\n\nArguments\n\nd: a UnivariateDistribution defined in Distributions.jl. \nregion: a real number âˆˆ [0, 1] specifying the proportion of the density of d of the highest density region. \nnum_steps: the number of steps to linearly space between the left and right of the bracket, inclusive, where l=0.0 and r=1.0-region. The lower and upper quantiles, region apart, at each of these steps is then calculated. The the lower and upper quantile at these steps with the minimum distance between them is estimated to be the HDR. num_steps is enforced to be at least 3 and odd to allow exact accuracy on symmetric distributions.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"}]
