The grid-based approach may be more robust for discrete distributions. Returns the found HDR interval as a vector with length two.\n\nRequires loading Optimization.jl and an additional package that contains optimization algorithms: OptimizationNLopt.jl may be a good starting point.\n\nArguments\n\nd: a UnivariateDistribution defined in Distributions.jl. \nregion: a real number ∈ [0, 1] specifying the proportion of the density of d of the highest density region. \nsolve_alg: an algorithm to use to solve for the highest density region defined within Optimization.jl. Good starting methods from NLopt may be NLopt.LN_BOBYQA(), NLopt.LN_NELDERMEAD() and NLopt.LD_LBFGS. Other packages can be used as well - see Overview of the Optimizers.\n\nKeyword Arguments\n\nsolve_kwargs: a NamedTuple of keyword arguments used to set solver options like reltol. Other arguments can be used, but the default of (reltol = 0.0001,) is expected to be sufficient. For a list of common solver arguments see: Common Solver Options. Other specific package arguments may also be available. For NLopt see Methods.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"internal_api/#Internal-API","page":"Internal API","title":"Internal API","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"internal_api/","page":"Internal API","title":"Internal API","text":"Pages = [\"internal_api.md\"]","category":"page"},{"location":"internal_api/","page":"Internal API","title":"Internal API","text":"UnivariateUnimodalHighestDensityRegion.region_handling\nUnivariateUnimodalHighestDensityRegion._univariate_unimodal_HDR ","category":"page"},{"location":"internal_api/#UnivariateUnimodalHighestDensityRegion.region_handling","page":"Internal API","title":"UnivariateUnimodalHighestDensityRegion.region_handling","text":"region_handling(d::UnivariateDistribution, region::Real)\n\nHandles values of region that are not between 0 and 1.\n\nIf region is equal to 0.0, the mode of the distribution will be returned, if defined, else the median will be returned.

It is only intended for use on unimodal distributions as the package assumes that there is a single, connected, highest density region. Both continuous and discrete distributions are supported. However, the assumptions of the method may break down for discrete distributions; the method of Ben O'Neill [2] may be more appropriate. This can be seen in the occasional inconsistency by width 1 between the HDR found by the grid-based and optimization-based approaches.
