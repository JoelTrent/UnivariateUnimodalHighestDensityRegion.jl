# Description

A simple package for computing the highest density region of a univariate distribution defined in [Distributions.jl](https://juliastats.org/Distributions.jl/stable/). It is only intended for use on unimodal distributions as the package assumes that there is a single, connected, highest density region. Both continuous and discrete distributions work as expected. The exported function will not error on bimodal distributions, but it will not identify the correct highest density regions. 

A grid-based approach and optimization-based approach are implemented. The optimisation approach will, in general, require fewer distribution quantile evaluations for the same level of accuracy. However, it requires loading [Optimization.jl](https://docs.sciml.ai/Optimization/stable/) and therefore requires more memory.

This is a performant alternative to [HighestDensityRegions.jl](https://github.com/tpapp/HighestDensityRegions.jl) when the distribution of interest is univariate and unimodal.
